Cheerz
======

Cheerz is a small mobile application that lets scouts randomly select a cheer from a list of cheers. 
This public repo simply holds some of the static data that the application needs.

For the actual application, please see [Cheerz on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.walkingriver.cheerz)
